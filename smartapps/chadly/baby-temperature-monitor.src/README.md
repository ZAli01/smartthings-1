# SmartThings Baby Temperature Monitor

Monitor a particular thermostat and if the temperature gets too cold or too hot, turn a specfic set of lights on.

The baby sleeps upstairs while our master bedroom is downstairs. The upstairs & downstairs are controlled by two separate HVAC units. After [reading this terrifying article](http://fortworth.citymomsblog.com/2016/06/05/the-days-are-long/), I wanted a way to know if the temperature is getting too hot or cold up there. Using this app, I can turn the bright overhead lights in our bedroom on when the temperature reaches a certain point. That should hopefully wake us up and we can go correct the situation upstairs.
