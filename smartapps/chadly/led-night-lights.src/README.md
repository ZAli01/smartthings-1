# SmartThings LED Night Lights

When opening the bedroom door while in sleep mode, turn the LED lights to a dim red. If opening the bedroom door after sunrise but still in sleep mode, turn LEDs to police mode. 

This app is highly specific to my use case. I have LED strip lights as under & over cabinet lights in the kitchen. When I open the bedroom door at night (which opens into the kitchen), I want to be able to see, but with red lights as I don't want to kill my night vision with bright white lights. Unfortunately, the builtin smart lighting app doesn't work with the Fibaro RGBW controller for setting the color. Hence this app.

Also, when I wake up in the morning (on days where I don't have a scheduled wakeup time), if I open the bedroom door and forget to put the house in _Home_ mode, it will turn the police lights on as a warning.
