# SmartThings LED Strip Light Controller

Tie the white levels of your Fibaro RGBW LED controller to other lights. 

This app is highly specific to my use case. I have LED strip lights as under & over cabinet lights in the kitchen. When I turn the overhead light on, I want the LEDs to be full brightness. When I dim the island light, I want the cabinet warm white lights to be set to the same dimmer level. 

## Installation

See the [installation instructions](../../../README.md#installation).

## How to Use

From the SmartThings mobile app:

1. Select `Marketplace` from the bottom navigation
2. Select the `SmartApps` tab
3. Scoll down and select the `My Apps` category

5. Configure your lights
6. Tap `Done` to complete the setup
