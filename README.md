## Installation

### Option 1: Github integration

The best way to get updates is to enable GitHub integration and add this repository.

1. Open the IDE and navigate to `My SmartApps`
2. Select `Settings`
3. Select `Add new repository`
4. Enter the following details:
	* Owner: `chadly`
	* Name: `smartthings`
	* Branch: `master`

Now whenever you need to update to the latest version, you can choose `â†“ Update from Repo`, select the app or device handler, and get your updates.

### Option 2: Manual Install

You can also install it manually for those of you who really enjoy copying & pasting everything.

1. Navigate to the app or device handler you want to install and copy the code.
2. Follow the instructions from the [ThingsThatAreSmart.wiki](http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=Using_Custom_Code#Using_a_Custom_SmartApp) on how to install a SmartApp.
